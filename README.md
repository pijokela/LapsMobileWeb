LapsMobileWeb
=============

Appengine web app for browsing practice lap times with a mobile device.

Building the app
================

The application consists of a single servlet. I currently have the 
Google app engine config in a separate project that is not in Github.
It should not be too hard to run the servlet without my configuration,
but I hope I find a way to put the configuration in to this repo also.
