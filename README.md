LapsMobileWeb
=============

Appengine web app for browsing practice lap times with a mobile device.

Building the app
================

The application consists of a two servlets. I currently have the 
Google app engine config in a separate project that is not in Github.
It should not be too hard to run the servlets without my configuration,
but I hope I find a way to put the configuration in to this repo also.

My installation
===============

I have the application installed at:
http://m-laps.appspot.com
